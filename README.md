This has 3 pieces of code
- estimate.py: this calculates your probability of winning given your hand
- play.py: a few agents that can play each other, one agent uses the probability decisions
- quick.py: uses `estimate` to give you quick estimate on your hand

The agents are quite simple: they have 3 actions: bet, fold, check.
